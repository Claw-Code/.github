# üêæ CLAW Code

**CLAW Code** is an AI-native, developer-first platform designed to supercharge 2D and 3D game development with **Unity** as the primary engine, **Gwen** as the customizable in-game UI toolkit, and **Groq**-powered large language models for real-time code generation and backend logic support.

CLAW empowers game developers to generate, preview, and iterate on gameplay mechanics, UI flows, and backend logic ‚Äî all with natural language prompts and live coding assistance.

---

## üß≠ Overview

CLAW Code accelerates end-to-end game development by combining a high-performance LLM backend with Unity‚Äôs ecosystem and a lightweight in-game UI layer (Gwen). It automates code scaffolding, runtime previews, and deployment workflows for both 2D and 3D games.

**Key Features:**

- AI-powered generation for Unity C# scripts (2D + 3D)
- UI scaffolding with Gwen (Unity-compatible)
- Live preview and code injection inside Unity Editor (via socket bridge)
- Real-time backend simulation using **Groq LLMs**
- Optional multiplayer logic scaffolds

---

## üéÆ Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping of Unity scenes, behaviors, and UI
- LLM-assisted game jam tools
- Education platforms for teaching Unity with AI support
- Real-time logic generation for NPCs, enemy AI, or quest systems
- Backend scripting for save/load systems or event triggers

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

CLAW Code includes the following components:

1. **Unity Frontend**
   - Scene loader and runtime injector
   - Gwen-based in-game UI module
   - Editor bridge (WebSocket or local pipe)

2. **LLM Backend**
   - Hosted on **Groq LPU** or **vLLM**
   - Specialized prompt templates for Unity (2D/3D workflows)
   - Actionable game-specific code suggestions (C#)

3. **Runtime Orchestrator**
   - Code hot-reloader inside Unity
   - Socket-based trigger system to evaluate code in live game sessions
   - Export system to package builds (WebGL, Android, etc.)

4. **Plugin Layer (WIP)**
   - Multiplayer scaffold (Mirror/Netcode for GameObjects)
   - Enemy/AI pattern generator
   - Procedural level scripting

## üöÄ One-Click Deploy

Once gameplay and logic are finalized:

- Click **Deploy**
- Choose target: WebGL, Windows, Android
- The game is bundled, exported, and optionally hosted (e.g., itch.io, S3)
